AWS Elastic Load Balancers:

Classic Load Balancer (CLB):
Explanation: The Classic Load Balancer is the legacy load balancer offered by AWS. It distributes incoming traffic evenly across 
multiple EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. CLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is best suited for applications 
that don't require advanced routing or content-based routing.

Application Load Balancer (ALB):
Explanation: The Application Load Balancer operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and is designed for routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic. 
It allows you to define routing rules based on content (e.g., URL path, headers), making it suitable for modern web applications with multiple services or microservices.

Network Load Balancer (NLB):
Explanation: The Network Load Balancer operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is optimized for handling TCP and UDP traffic. 
NLB is suitable for applications that require high performance, low-latency, and the ability to handle millions of requests per second, 
such as gaming or IoT applications.

Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):
Explanation: The Gateway Load Balancer is designed for distributing traffic to virtual appliances like firewalls, intrusion detection
systems (IDS), or other network appliances. It allows you to route traffic to a group of virtual appliances to inspect and filter network traffic.


Important services to add for interview in aws (if asked like which services in aws used to validate, optimize, cost optimize, performance optimize with aws infrastructure, security vulnarability with aws accounts)
 => There are two 2 services
   ==> AWS Security Hub
      => It is a service designed to help you monitor and manage security and compliance across multiple  AWS accounts and services.

   ==> AWS Trusted Advisor
      => Similarity: AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations to help optimize AWS resources for cost,     performance, and security.
       Key Features: It offers security checks related to exposure of resources, such as S3 buckets with public access.
       Use Cases: Cost optimization, resource security, and performance improvement.
