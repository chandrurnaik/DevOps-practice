my self Chandrashekhar R. I'm currently work as a SRE Devops Engineer at Rakuten and i have 
over all 5.1 years of experience in this field. Being an SRE i was focused on ensuring the 
reliability, scalability, and performance of complex software systems.
I have a deep understanding of the SRE DevOps principles and practices.

My expertise includes designing robust monitoring and alerting systems, incident response 
management, Change Management, Capacity Planning, Documenting Service Architecture, plans, procedures
and implementing infrastructure as code, reducing downtime, Automate Repeatative and 
Manual operations, enhancing system security, and driving cost-efficiency through effective SRE practices.
Work under SLA (Service Level Agreement), Change, Incident Management and CAB meetings to
increase productivity & performance of application.

##  My journey in the SRE and DevOps field has given me hands-on experience with a 
wide range of technologies ##
I have expertise in Devops tools like:
Cloud computing platforms AWS
containerization tool such as Docker
Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes
Configuration Management tool such as Ansible
Infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform
Monitoring and logging tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, ELK Stack
CI/CD tools such as Jenkins
Build Tool such as Maven 
SCM Tool Git, GitHub
Application Server tool tomcat
Programming Language as Python 
Scripting Language as Shell, Python 


In my current role at Rakuten, I was responsible for the reliability and performance of 
a large-scale Trade Investment Baking platform. I was working closely with developers and operations 
teams to implement SRE and DevOps best practices to the project including setting up and managing 
large-scale Kubernetes clusters, automate the complex deployment by CI/CD pipelines, handled complex 
cloud migration Test, Pre-prod and Prod environments, handled complex infra provisioning by terraform, 
Setting up application centric Disaster Recovery, Automating Various tasks using Bash Shell, Python, 
Maven and Jenkins to monitor infra and applications setted up ELK stack from scratch.
