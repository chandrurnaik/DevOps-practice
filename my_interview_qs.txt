Jenkins cicd process (just a breif)
=> we are using source code management tool github in our company 
=> and integrated github to jenkins with git webhook
=> whenever developer push changes to remote repo, by webhook jenkins job automatically triggers
=> in jenkis using declarative pipeline job we are inplementing contineous integration and delivery approach 
=> and also we are maintaining jenkinsfiles in github only, just calling it in jenkins pipeline job
=> jenkinsfile involves ci stages like checkout, build, code scan, image build, image scan, 
   image push
=> we are maintaing dockerfile in github and using it in image build stage 
=> jenkinsfile involves cd stages like Deploy or update deployment file 
=> both build, push docker image we are doing it by shell scripting 
=> deploying to kubernetes by helm, again by helm commands 
=> we are maintaining all builds, docker images and helm chart in jfrog artifactory 

Default port of jfrog is => 9000 
How to integrate jfrog to jenkins 
   => Install plugin Artifactory in jenkins => go to Manage Jenkins => system => search for jfrog
     => set jfrog url and username, password 
   
   => using in pipeline => 2 ways => using jfrog cli and using blocks like rtupload and all (usually i refer documentory)
   => for jfrog cli we need to install Jfrog plugin 
   => we install and run jfrog artifactory in ec2 instance just like jenkins

How to integrate sonarqube to jenkins 
  => for this install sonarqube plugin in jenkins 
  => while code scan stage in pipeline, we need to pass sonarqube url 
  => and also just like jenkins server, have install and run sonarqube on ec2 instance and moniter
